        I never really knew what I seeked for in my life. I have always been an 
        adventurous girl who wandered around the mysterious aspects of what I call life.
        Last summer I was able to experience knew things in such a wonderful enviornment 
        full of people that I truly adore. I make the world sound cruel, but you never know
        what you want until you actually find it. I'm not saying that I found what I wanted, for 
        I am still naive. I just got a great opportunity to see another side of the world. and I 
        I was able to meet new people, get involved with different extracaricular activities, and learn at the same time.
        For instance, I did blacksmithing, rock climbing, and white water rafting. It was even better to bond with people I wouldn't have met if it wasn't for this program.
        Besides that, I also took courses and gained college experience my dorming in Carbondale,Colorado, a place I never imagined to go.
